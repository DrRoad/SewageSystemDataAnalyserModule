# SewageSystemDataAnalyserModule
My final year project for my computer science course is an extension of the IOT - based sewage scheduling system implemented in real time conditions in my college and with added functionality such as data analysis and report generatioN. For analysis and visulaisation of data, I used R and the module built took data from the Amazon RDS MySQL database where my system's data was collected. The module is also hosted on the clous in Amazon AWS EC2. The set of programs establish conectivity between R workspace and the RDS database and also detect patterns, generate visual graphs. Feedback will be appreciated
